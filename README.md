The Golden Ratio (why it is so irrational) - Numberphile : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg

### Watch the Numberphile video above to understand the purpose this visualization program has. This project is simply a clone I made to behave similarily to the program shown in the video.

## How to use:
  - Value in textbox represents the amount of rotation between dots
  - If you want to set the value of rotation to a number you typed in use update button to update the display
  - Click RUN to iterate through rotation values
