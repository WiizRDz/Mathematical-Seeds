The Golden Ratio (why it is so irrational) - Numberphile : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg

Mathematical Seeds is program inspired by the video https://youtu.be/sj8Sg8qnjOg by Numberphile talking about the irrationality of numbers. They explain a concept of rotating circles around one central point by 'x' number of rotations. 

By recognizing patterns in the spokes formed you can find approximations of numbers. As a result irrational numbers that are difficult to approximate, like the golden ratio displayed to the left, look more random and it is difficult to find patterns. 

This tool simply recreates the effect shown within the video and is very interesting to watch.

How to use:
  - Value in textbox represents the amount of rotation between dots
  - If you want to set the value of rotation to a number you typed in use update button to update the display
  - Click RUN to iterate through rotation values
